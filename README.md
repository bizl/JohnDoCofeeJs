This site will allow customers to walk into a shop, look up the shop's menu on their phone, quickly place an order, get an order number for their item. And then wait in a queue.  Just like buying in Argos!

We expect many many shops to join our programme. 

Client enters a shop
/ Chooses the shops menu or their mobile phone detects using GPS where they are
/ Shows them cart items
/ They make their selections (Add to cart), place order
/ They get an order number, cashier gets a notification or declines order. 
/ They wait around
/ They get a notification when order is ready or cashier shouts out
/ They pick up and leave
/ Cashier closes their session
